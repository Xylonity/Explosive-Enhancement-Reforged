# Explosive Enhancement: Reforged

Fabric version of this <a href="https://github.com/Superkat32/Explosive-Enhancement">mod</a>.
<br><br>
This is a simple cosmetic mod that adds many new particles when an explosion occurs, any of which can be enabled/disabled at will. You can also completely enable/disable the mod via the config too.
<br><br>
There is also a special underwater explosion effect. You can make it so that there are lots of bubbles during an underwater explosion for a satisfying effect!

## Configuration
You can edit the mod through the mod's configuration, located at config/explosiveenhancement.toml
<br><br>
## Aditional info
There are 2 versions of this mod. CLIENT ONLY, required just on client. And CLIENT & SERVER, which is required on both (use this if there are incompatibilities with other client-sided mods). You can disable the mod inside the mod's config if you don't want to see custom explosions.
